    <h1>How to build your authority, overcome obscurity, scale your business, and build an audience of ideal buyers for your products and services...</h1>

    <p>Here's where you are right now. <br/> You already know this, just saying it anyway. <br/> Now, here is what WILL work. <br/> First you need a product or service that the world needs (you already got this part down). <br/> Second, you need to build trust and authentic relationship with your audience. <br/> People like Gary Vee, Grant Cordone, Tony Robbins, or anyone else who's dominating the market, are dominating that market for one reason and one reason only. Trust. <br/> They've built businesses that will last the test of time. Even way after they die. <br/> Everyone is looking for a "unique selling proposition". If you have an audience of raving fans that trust you, you don't need to be unique. <br/> I want to show you how to use your free time to be the best version of yourself as a futsal player, you will eat better, train better, sleep better, all this while maintaining you perform well at your work.</p>
